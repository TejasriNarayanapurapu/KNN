# KNN
Objective
Understand and implement the KNN algorithm to solve classification problems using real-world datasets.

🛠 Tools Used
Scikit-learn – for model building

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib – for data visualization

🔍 Key Highlights
KNN from scratch and using Scikit-learn

Optimal k value selection

Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix

Visualization of classification boundaries (optional)

📊 Example Dataset
Iris Dataset (multi-class classification)

✅ Outcomes
Solid understanding of how KNN works

Model performance analysis

Hyperparameter tuning (choosing best k)
